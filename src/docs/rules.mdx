### 3.1 Griefing in claims
Damaging land in or around claimed areas is prohibited. Offenders will be warned and the damage rolled back. Repeated offenses may result in a permanent ban. Placing and removing blocks during siege war events is allowed when necessary. Examples of griefing include:

- Cobble monsters (structures built using lava and water)
- Lava/water curtains (walls of falling lava/water)
- TNT craters
- Mass spawning entities (e.g., chickens, boats) in or around a town

### 3.2 Griefing in Wilderness
Griefing structures or terrain in the wilderness is allowed as long as it is not near claimed land. Major terrain grief can be rolled back upon request. Desecrating public infrastructure that connects towns is prohibited.

### 3.3 Town Claims
Towns cannot claim land to block neighboring towns from expanding. Creating claim arms, having unclaimed areas within town borders, and overclaiming another town's chunks to split it are prohibited. Towns created solely to block other towns will be removed.

### 3.4 Major Terraforming
To preserve map geography, major terraforming that changes the Dynmap view is not allowed. This includes draining large lakes/rivers, creating artificial islands, or covering the ocean with platforms. Vertical terraforming is allowed as it does not change the Dynmap view. Draining rivers is allowed, as well as expanding river width inside town claims. Expansion of your coast is allowed, solely under the condition that it is terraformed properly and does not seem grotesque. There is a limit to this expansion, however—you can expand your coast no more than a chunk from the original terrain length.

### 3.5 Artificial Islands
Artificial islands are to be created with proper terrain that goes to the sea floor and with trees; any platform "islands" will be disputed. The maximum size is 4x4 chunks. Artificial islands that have been created in real life are allowed.

### 3.6 Map Art
Map art is allowed as long as it does not interfere with other towns. The area must be claimed to avoid proximity griefing. Map art must not contain nudity, sexual content, racist imagery, or any content breaking rule 2.
