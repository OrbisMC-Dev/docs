Bandits have player-like bodies, and they wear gray-dyed leather armor. They hold iron swords, iron axes, diamond swords, or bows.

## Bandit Types
There are 4 types of bandits, swordsmen, archers, axemen, and horseback swordsmen.

- Archers hold bows and shoot a hurricane of arrows at once.

- Horseback swordsmen hold diamond swords and attack with simple slashing attacks, however, they are on horses and are much faster than other bandit types.

Bandits will spawn in either scout groups or attack groups. A scout group usually consists of one or two horseback swordsmen and archers. However, an attack group will consist of multiple archers, swordsmen, horseback swordsmen, and one or two axemen.
