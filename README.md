### How to edit documents
You can make documents by going cloning this branch then going into src/docs then you will see all of the documents pages. To make a page simply make a new file with the file extension .mdx
After that use markdown to format your pages, feel free to use a drag and drop markdown editor then just copy the source into the file you want to make a page for.
